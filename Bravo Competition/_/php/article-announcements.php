<h2>July 7th, 2014: PolyAtomic Ions</h2>
<p>This is where you will look every evening for downloads and announcements. Your
syllabus and other related materials will be placed
here. Make sure you check it every night.</p>

<p>Begin by downloading this <a href="apstuff/APChemistryFall_2014.pdf">course
description</a> from ETS. There is no need to print it out but you will want to
read it. </p>

<p>Here is your first <a href="Syllabus/first%20syllabus%2014_15.pdf">syllabus</a>.
Print it out (try printing on both sides of the page) and assemble a binder
according to the instructions in the syllabus. Do not forget that summer
homework needs to be complete by the first day of school when it will be
collected. Have your binder ready for the first day of school. Details of how
to prepare the binder are in the first syllabus.</p>

<p>You will be tested the second day of school on the summer homework.</p>

<p>Here are three items for the summer HW.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="apstuff/SummerHW.pdf">Item One</a></li>
    <li><a href="apstuff/SummerHW2014.pdf">Item Two</a></li>
    <li><a href="apstuff/APNomenclature.pdf">Item Three</a></li>
</ul>
<p> case you lost it here is <a href="PARENTS/Nomenclature.pdf">Nomenclature
Simplified</a>.</p>
<p>These are due on the first day of classes. You will have a test the second day.</p>

<p>Here are several lecture outlines to help you review the most important items from
the first year course.</p>

<p><a href="apstuff/HistoryAtomicStructure.pdf">History of Atomic Structure</a></p>

<p><a href="apstuff/AtomsMolecules.pdf">Atoms and Molecules</a></p>

<p><a href="apstuff/Nomenclature.pdf">Nomenclature</a></p>

<p><a href="apstuff/MathematicsMoles.pdf">Mathematics and the Mole</a></p>

<p><a href="apstuff/FormulaProblems.pdf">Formula Problems</a></p>

<p><a href="apstuff/Molarity.pdf">Molarity</a></p>

<p>Okay here is a reward for those of you with type A personalities. Come in on the
first day of class with your binder set up as outlined in the syllabus and
start the new school year with a 5 point extra credit bonus.</p>

<p>Welcome to Honors chemistry. As of right now everyone has an AEE. Make sure you keep it that way.</p>
 
<p>This is where you can look everyday for announcements, information, and important downloads for your chemistry class. Bookmark this page and check it every evening before you go to bed.</p>

<p>One problem that comes up every year in this class is learning the names of the polyatomic ions and elements. This is the alphabet that we use in chemistry and must be known as well as the letters we use to spell words. It is something that happens ion the second chapter. If you are interested in getting ahead here are some ideas. Make your flash cards now and start learning long before you need to.</p>

<p>The first set is of the names of the polyatomic ions. Here is a handout that has a good list. Make one card for each of the polyatomic ions listed in table four on page four of this handout. A good is example is Hydroxide on one side and OH— on the other.</p>

<p>This is a video that everyone should watch over the summer. A short quiz on the content will be given on the first day of school.</p>

<p> Sometimes it feels dreamy to think about worlds that parallel our own. The possibilities seem endless. Is there a universe
    where we win in the competitions we dedicate our time to? What if we were born in a different planet or country? Here it is, have fun watching!</p>
